# Ticketsup
Ticketsup is a full stack, web application that was built on the model view controller patter. 
Ticketsup is both a movie and food booking application that was developed by three Codeup students for a capstone project.

## Motivation
Ticketsup was created to be a user-friendly web application to help the customer skip the lines at the movie theater. A user can order their movie tickets and food ahead of time. Once they arrive at the theater, the food is then prepared once the user scans in using a qr code sent by Ticketsup.
